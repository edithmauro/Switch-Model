# Switch-Model

This is a three-dimensional model based off of the Nintendo Switch, a popular video game consol.  It was created using CATIA, a modeling software.  In this folder, both screen shots in a singular word document and the specific parts are included along with the CATIA files.  The purpose of this project was to showcased my learning of this modeling program in the CGT 11600 course at Purdue University.
